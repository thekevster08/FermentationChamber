Version 0.1

Basic Functionality Created

Feature Request
-add the following buttons: "start collection", "stop collection", "New", "Save" "Load"
-Have a green light indicating collection
-in plotChart instead of running getJSON, make a call to a function to copy everything from 
    the db to the json file, then call json

Stretch goals:
-update constantly
    -its really not feasable to have it updating constantly, so lets not worry about that
    
Known Bugs:
-you need to have a seperate script always running seperate of the data collection to dump 
    to JSON. if you load something while its not running you are not going to get any json 
    data.
